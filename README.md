# Basic-projects
Small projects in html/css/js, so far most of them are picked from John Smilga's [list of beginner javascript projects](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects) and I then implement them by myself.
## Projects list
- [Random color flipper](https://l-a-r-t.github.io/Basic-projects/Color%20flipper/)
> Click on the button to randomly switch the background color
- [Clicks counter](https://l-a-r-t.github.io/Basic-projects/Counter/)
> Counter that tracks total clicks since last refresh (no persistent storage yet), clicks per second and clicks last min
- [Countdown app](https://l-a-r-t.github.io/Basic-projects/Timer/)
> Gives the countdown until a date that can be chosen by the user
## WIP
- Dashboard
> Front-end only, provides weather, todos, quick access to favorite pages and ???
- Landing page
> Recreating the main page of my gamedev venture [Waterside Studios](https://waterside-studios.com/) in htmt/css/js instead of Wordpress.
