# Basic-projects
Small projects in html/css/js, so far most of them are picked from John Smilga's [list of beginner javascript projects](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects) and I then implement them by myself.
## Projects list

> Click on the button to randomly switch the background color

## WIP

- Landing page
> Recreating the main page of my gamedev venture [Waterside Studios](https://waterside-studios.com/) in htmt/css/js instead of Wordpress.
